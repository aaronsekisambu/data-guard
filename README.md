This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

Clone the app from the repo.


```
Install the modules, use yarn
then run yarn dev
```

Server will run on [http://localhost:3020](http://localhost:3020) and client will run on any open port

### My approach

1. I use Next js for frontend and json-server for mock API 
2. I use the provided data structure without creating any new endpoints
3. I used a single hook to handle all functionalities because some data was shared accross multiple pages


## Deploy on herokul
